        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Remember waking up on Saturday mornings as a kid? The first memories that come to my mind usually involve a nice big bowl of cereal while watching cartoons. It doesn't even matter that my mom would <strong>rarely</strong> let us have the so called <em>sugar cereals</em> (you know, the best kinds of cereal?). Take a trip down memory lane with this delicious and nutri- .... ahem, well this delicious recipe!
